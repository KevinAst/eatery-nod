# eateries feature

The **'eateries'** feature provides a presentation of eateries, a list
of the pooled (and filtered) restaurants, along with the ability to
select an eatery through a random spin operation.  Selected eateries
have the ability to phone them, visit their web site, and navigate to
them.
